sia
===

sia is a simple ical aggregator in alpha stage.

Features:

- retrieving multiple remote icals
- filtering events with regex-based filters
- display events of a day, week (todo) or month (todo)
- so far a command line tool, KISS

This is very much work in progress.


Usage
===

sia depends on [icalendar](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/icalendar). For installation, see their page.

sia is configured via text files in the ~/.sia/ directory. These files are:
- __urls__ : on remote ical location per line
- __filters__ : if an event summary matches on of the lines, it is not displayed

For more on usage, try --help.
